# Augmented Reality Maze

This project is an augmented reality app for iPhones and one of the first projects I completed after starting my masters program at Washington University in St. Louis.
The app produces an AR maze on the screen of the iPhone that the user then navigates while attempting to find the exit.

### Installing

Requires a Mac with Xcode installed and an iPhone 6s or later model.
With those available, Xcode can be used to install the app onto an iPhone where it can then be run easily.

### Demo

A video of the app in use can be found inside this repository.  The file name is "AR Maze video".
